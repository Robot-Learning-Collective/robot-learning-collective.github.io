Welcome to the Robot Learning Collective. We are an independent community sharing research in embodied AI. We care about individuality, curiosity, and practical mindset. Our goal is to bring passionate people together, do cool and impactful projects, and share what we learn with the wider community.


# 🚀 Our projects

## [VLA-0-Smol](vla-0-smol.md)
We present a compact VLA model that achieves a high score on simulation benchmarks with a clear recipe to reproduce results and a detailed ablation study showing the impact of key design choices.

## [Winning Behavior 1K Challenge](winning-behavior-1k-challenge.md)
We took **1st place** in the NeurIPS 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge, the largest VLA simulation competition. The task was to solve 50 diverse household activities by imitating human behavior. Everything we built is fully open, including the code, models, and analysis.
